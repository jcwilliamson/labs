# Analogue Inputs and Potential Dividers
## Analogue and Digital Signals
An analogue signal is one which is continuous in time and in value, meaning that it can have any possible value at any possible point in time. This is in contrast to a digital signal, which is discrete in value, meaning that it can only have a predetermined set of possible values, in the case of a digital signal, either "1" or "0". 
### Analogue inputs for Arduino
The Arduino you have been given for your robot has some analogue input pins. In the case of a microcontroller, these pins are connected to the input of a Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC), which takes a sample of the input at a point in time and converts it to a binary value suitable for a microcontroller to handle. The Arduino has a 10 bit ADC, which divides the range between 0V and 5V into 1024 steps. The change required in the analogue signal required for a 1 bit change in the value produced by the ADC is known as its "resolution". The resolution of the ADC can be calculated as follows:

$$\text{Resolution} = \frac{5}{1024}$$

This gives the resolution of the ADC as 4.9mV. This function of the Arduino can be accessed using the **analogread(analogpin)** function on anything connected to the Arduino's dedicated analogue pins. Your Arduino has 6 such pins, noted by A0, A1, A2, A3,A4 ,A5. This may be useful for some of your sensors, as some of them do not return a digital value, and instead return a range of analogue values, particularly if you need more detail from the sensors than simply on or off.

## Potential Dividers
A potential divider is a digital circuit that consists of 2 or more resistors. This is useful for bringing a voltage that is out of range of your Arduino into range. Here, Ohm's law causes a drop in voltage across the first resistor (R1) which is proportional to its resistance, This leaves the second resistor (R2) to drop the remaining voltage.

Above is an example of a potential divider, where the output voltage (Vout) is given by:

$$\text{Vout} = \text{V1} \times \frac{\text{R2}}{\text{R1+R2}}$$

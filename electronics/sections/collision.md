# Collision Sensors

Before you can do any practical electronics, you need to have some understanding of the following concepts:

* Charge
* Current
* Potential Difference (aka. Voltage)
* Resistance

**Charge** is a fundamental property of matter. This means it is something we can observe but not explain in other terms. In this case we can observe that some particles attract each other, some repel, and some experience no force. Since there are three possible states they were called positive, negative and neutral (no charge). Charge is measured in **Coulombs (C)**.

Current is the **rate of flow** of electric charge. This means the amount of charge flowing in one second. In the case of a wire **electrons will flow**, but in electronics we arenâ€™t very interested in which particles are moving so we assume that positive charges flow to negative. Current is measured in **Amperes (A)**. If a wire carries a current of 1 Amp, then it means that in each second, 1 Coulomb of charge (about 6250000000000000000 electrons) moves through that wire!

**Potential difference** is the difference in potential energy for each Coulomb of charge. For example, if you use a voltmeter to test the voltage across a battery, and your voltmeter says 9 Volts, it means that each coulomb of charge leaves with 9 Joules more energy than it entered with. For a component the voltmeter would tell you the energy lost by each charge. PD is measured in **Volts (V)**.

**Resistance** is the easiest quantity to define. It is defined by the equation:

$$\text{Resistance} = \frac{\text{Potential Difference}}{\text{Current}}$$

$$R = \frac{V}{I}$$

Resistance is measured in Ohms ($\Omega$).
